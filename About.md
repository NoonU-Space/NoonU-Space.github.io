# Energy Harvest FIRST to Accelerate The Exploration of Space

FIRST ... we focus on getting the energy we'll need to power everything we do [to prepare to push further into space], ie quantum computuing, particle accelerator labs for exploring Matter/Time/Dimensions aspects of Physics.

## How much energy is available to be harvested

Never mind converting all mass into energy ... we might get to that later ... but FIRST, let's just use the Sun ... and that means REALLY ***USING*** what energy the Sun is putting out right now.

Of the entire surface area of a sphere characterized by Earth's orbit of the Sun ... 1/2.2 billionth of that surface is occupied by the entire area of the Earth facing the Sun.

If we could capture ALL of the solar energy coming to the Earth, we could probably power the Earth for 50 years [with what we can capture in 1 year] ... but this is much more ambitious ... we want to capture 1/1000th of the Sun's energy in a Dyson sphere which would still give the Earth all of the incoming solar energy it recieves now ... but THAT 1/1000th amount is would be 2.2 million times the incoming solar energy the Earth recieves now or perhaps 100 million times the energy used by humans on Earth.

***FORGET ABOUT little solar panels on your roof ... we need to be thinking about building an energy harvesting Dyson sphere.*** The Earth only occupies a minuscule fraction of the surface area of its orbit around the Sun. It's like a tiny dot on a massive sphere. The exact ratio is extremely small, on the order of 1 to billions.  Calculating it precisely requires knowing the Earth's cross-sectional area and the surface area of a sphere with a radius equal to Earth's orbital distance.

1. Earth's cross-sectional area:

We can approximate the area of Earth as a perfect circle, ie as if the sphere were cut in half and the half facing the Sun would be 100% solar collector.

* Earth's radius (r) ≈ 6,371 km
* Area of a circle = πr² ≈ 3.14 * (6371 km)² ≈ 127,516,117 km²

2. Surface area of Earth's orbit (sphere):

* Earth's average distance from the Sun (R) ≈ 149,600,000 km (1 Astronomical Unit)
* Surface area of a sphere = 4πR² ≈ 4 * 3.14 * (149,600,000 km)² ≈ 2.81237×10^17 km²

3. The ratio:

* (Earth's cross-sectional area) / (Orbit's surface area) ≈ 127,516,117 km² / 2.81237×10^17 km² ≈ 4.53 x 10^-10

**Result: The Earth occupies approximately 4.53 x 10^-10 (or about 1 in 2.2 billion) of the surface area of its orbit around the Sun.**
