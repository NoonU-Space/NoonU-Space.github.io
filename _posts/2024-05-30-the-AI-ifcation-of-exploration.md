Exploration is fundamentally about autodidactic learning, but now we can use AI assistants to delve into conversations about matters that we hazily familiar with, but have not mastered and are learning our way through the material.

Hypothesis generation is fundamentally intuitive, probably more like prayer than anything else ... it is fundamentally beyond the scope of logic and reason at first ... although after you have the gist of an idea, you can begin to apply reason or logic to begin to make the hypothesis more concrete, although we might also have to use Wolfram and Mathematica to explore the mathematics underlaying our hard science fiction autodidactic hypothesization ... the point of this kind of learning is to develop testable hypotheses and to begin thinking about how the test will be carried out.
