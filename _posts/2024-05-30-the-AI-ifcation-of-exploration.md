Exploration is fundamentally like autodidactic learning in that it's about expanding one's understanding using what one already understands to invent ways to teach oneself about unknowns ... but nowadays, it has moved into the virtual realm, since we can use AI assistants to delve into conversations about matters that we hazily familiar with, but have not mastered and are learning our way through the material.

Hypothesis generation is fundamentally intuitive, probably more like prayer than anything else ... it is fundamentally beyond the scope of logic and reason at first ... although after you have the gist of an idea, you can begin to apply reason or logic to begin to make the hypothesis more concrete, although we might also have to use Wolfram and Mathematica to explore the mathematics underlaying our hard science fiction autodidactic hypothesization ... the point of this kind of learning is to develop testable hypotheses and to begin thinking about how the test will be carried out.

How we structure a research program is the NEXT step ... after we have a coherent idea, per something published as hard science fiction and then reviewed and commented upon by a larger audience.
