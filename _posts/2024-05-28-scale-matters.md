## TIME, not just Space

It's a 10,000 year project. 

AT MINIMUM, it will take 10 generations or 250 years to get the first part of the Dyson Sphere built, which is MAINLY about exploration and construction of the next levels of science and knowledge that will furnish the basic building blocks for beginning to construct the architecture of the Dyson Sphere.

**STOP thinking in human scale**. You cannot begin to contemplate the Dyson Sphere in terms of human scale.  

## Other Dimensions and the Nature of Matter and Reality

STOP thinking in terms of 3 dimensions of space or 4 dimensions of space-time.  Space-time is completely insufficient.

The FUNDAMENTAL architecture of the Dyson Sphere is based on quantum field theory and the nature of matter and reality ... it's NOT about moving matter around; it's about moving energy around and using fields. There's no good reason to displace that much matter, although the early probes will need to be constructed from the technologies that we have available ... so, of course, there IS enough matter to move, just in terms of INITIAL probes.

## Nano, Micro, Macro, Mega, Giga, Tera, Peta, Exa, Zetta, Yotta

***It's not about HUMAN scale shit!***

STOP thinking in terms of manned space exploration.  The scale of the construction of the Dyson Sphere is BEYOND anything that 99.99999% of human beings have ever contemplated.
