## Noon Universe Space Exploration

Our exploration STARTS with exploring a niche of [AWESOME hard science fiction](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi).

Here are 30 iconic examples of [hard science fiction](#hard-science-fiction), primarily set in the 22nd century and beyond, compared to the Noon Universe series by the Strugatsky Brothers:

1. **The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson (Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars)** is a detailed depiction of Mars colonization and terraforming in the 22nd-23rd centuries, similar to the Noon Universe's focus on space exploration. The Trilogy, consists of Red Mars, Green Mars, and Blue Mars and chronicles the colonization and terraforming of Mars over the course of nearly two centuries. In Red Mars, the initial colonists (the "First Hundred") establish a base on Mars and begin the terraforming process, but face challenges from the harsh environment and political disputes between those wanting to preserve Mars and those wanting to fully terraform it. Key events include the introduction of plant life, establishment of cities, and a violent revolution. Green Mars depicts the aftermath of the revolution and an intensifying terraforming effort that introduces animals, thickens the atmosphere and raises temperatures to melt ice. Underground aquifers are tapped. Political factions continue to clash over the direction of Mars' development. In Blue Mars, the terraforming is largely complete - Mars now has oceans, a breathable atmosphere and Earthlike terrain and climate. It has achieved independence from Earth, which has been ravaged by overpopulation and climate change. Martian society continues to evolve and spread across the planet. Key themes include the **logistics** and **ethics of terraforming**, the **evolution of human society and economics on a new world**, the **relationship between humanity and nature**, and the **contrast between a dying Earth and a vibrant Mars**. The story is told from the perspective of multiple characters over several generations. 

2. Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke - A mysterious alien spacecraft enters the solar system in the 22nd century, prompting human exploration.

The Noon Universe shares similarities with many of these works in terms of its hard science fiction approach and focus on space exploration and futuristic societies. However, it is distinguished by its uniquely Soviet perspective, episodic storytelling style, and utopian ideals rooted in the authors' experiences.

### Hard Science Fiction

_Novels which place an emphasis on scientific accuracy and/or technical detail; where the science itself is a central topic._

#### [A Deepness in the Sky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226004.A_Deepness_in_the_Sky) (2000) _by [Vernor Vinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge)_ [4.32]

Though written after _A Fire upon the Deep_, _A Deepness in the Sky_ is a prequel to Vinge's earlier novel, and shares one of its protagonists: the Qeng Ho trader Pham Nuwen. Though I read _A Fire upon the Deep_ once and enjoyed it, I've read _A Deepness in the Sky_ at least half a dozen times, and consider it my favorite hard sci-fi novel, period. Vernor Vinge was one of the first people to propose the idea of the technological singularity, and the near-future novels he wrote a decade or more ago have revealed themselves to be almost eerily prescient. - [@isochronous](https://github.com/isochronous)

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > After thousands of years searching, humans stand on the verge of first contact with an alien race. Two human groups: the Qeng Ho, a culture of free traders, and the Emergents, a ruthless society based on the technological enslavement of minds.
  >
  > The group that opens trade with the aliens will reap unimaginable riches. But first, both groups must wait at the aliens' very doorstep for their strange star to relight and for their planet to reawaken, as it does every two hundred and fifty years....

#### [A Fire Upon the Deep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711.A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep) (1992) _by [Vernor Vinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge)_ [4.1]

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > _A Fire upon the Deep_ is the big, breakout book that fulfills the promise of Vinge’s career to date: a gripping tale of galactic war told on a cosmic scale.
  >
  > Thousands of years hence, many races inhabit a universe where a mind’s potential is determined by its location in space, from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures and technology can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these “regions of thought,” but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.
  >
  > Fleeing the threat, a family of scientists, including two children, are taken captive by the Tines, an alien race with a harsh medieval culture, and used as pawns in a ruthless power struggle. A rescue mission, not entirely composed of humans, must rescue the children—and a secret that may save the rest of interstellar civilization.
</details>

#### [Aurora](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23197269-aurora) (2015) _by [Kim Stanley Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson)_ [3.7]

This was, I thought, an emotional read. I really connected with the characters and their struggle. It was interesting seeing the ways they overcame each obstacle despite overwhelming odds. It also shows what could happen when desperate people are left to fend for themselves without a governing force. - [@davidmerrique](https://github.com/davidmerrique)

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > A major new novel from one of science fiction's most powerful voices, AURORA tells the incredible story of our first voyage beyond the solar system.
  >
  > Brilliantly imagined and beautifully told, it is the work of a writer at the height of his powers.
  >
  > Our voyage from Earth began generations ago.
  >
  > Now, we approach our new home.
  >
  > AURORA.

#### [Blindsight (Firefall #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48484.Blindsight) (2006) _by [Peter Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Watts_%28author%29)_ [4.0]

A cast of strange and wonderful characters. Overarching themes on consciousness, transhumanism, humanity and first contact. This book has everything. - [@davidmerrique](https://github.com/davidmerrique)

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > It’s been two months since a myriad of alien objects clenched about the Earth, screaming as they burned. The heavens have been silent since—until a derelict space probe hears whispers from a distant comet. Something talks out there: but not to us. Who to send to meet the alien, when the alien doesn’t want to meet? Send a linguist with multiple-personality disorder, and a biologist so spliced to machinery he can’t feel his own flesh. Send a pacifist warrior, and a vampire recalled from the grave by the voodoo of paleogenetics. Send a man with half his mind gone since childhood. Send them to the edge of the solar system, praying you can trust such freaks and monsters with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they’ve been sent to find—but you’d give anything for that to be true, if you knew what was waiting for them.
</details>

#### [Children of Time (Children of Time #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25499718-children-of-time) (2015) _by [Adrian Tchaikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Tchaikovsky)_ [4.29]

A truly epic "evolutionary science fiction" story about animal uplift that feels very well researched. Tchaikovsky manages to perfectly immerse the reader in a radically different mindset. Even arachnofobics will root for the protagonists of the story. - [@nahkampf](https://github.com/nahkampf)

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > The last remnants of the human race left a dying Earth, desperate to find a new home among the stars. Following in the footsteps of their ancestors, they discover the greatest treasure of the past age — a world terraformed and prepared for human life. But all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned, the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for them, pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's worst nightmare. Now two civilizations are on a collision course, both testing the boundaries of what they will do to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the true heirs of this new Earth?
</details>

#### [Diaspora](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156785.Diaspora) (1997) _by [Greg Egan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Egan)_ [4.1]

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > By the end of the 30th century humanity has the capability to travel the universe, to journey beyond earth and beyond the confines of the vulnerable human frame.
  >
  > The descendants of centuries of scientific, cultural and physical development divide into three: fleshers—true Homo sapiens; Gleisner robots—embodying human minds within machines that interact with the physical world; and polises—supercomputers teeming with intelligent software, containing the direct copies of billions of human personalities now existing only in the virtual reality of the polis.
  >
  > Diaspora is the story of Yatima—a polis being created from random mutations of the Konishi polis base mind seed—and of humankind, Of an astrophysical accident that spurs the thousandfold cloning of the polises. Of the discovery of an alien race and of a kink in time that means humanity—whatever form it takes—will never again be threatened by acts of God.
</details>

#### [Dragon’s Egg](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263466.Dragon_s_Egg) (1980) _by [Robert L. Forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Forward)_ [4.1]

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > In a moving story of sacrifice and triumph, human scientists establish a relationship with intelligent life forms—the cheela—living on Dragon’s Egg, a neutron star where one Earth hour is equivalent to hundreds of their years. The cheela culturally evolve from savagery to the discovery of science, and for a brief time men are their diligent teachers.
</details>

#### [Echopraxia (Firefall #2)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490708-echopraxia) (2014) _by [Peter Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Watts_%28author%29)_ [3.8]

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > Prepare for a different kind of singularity in this follow-up to the Hugo-nominated novel Blindsight
  >
  > It's the eve of the twenty-second century: a world where the dearly departed send postcards back from Heaven and evangelicals make scientific breakthroughs by speaking in tongues; where genetically engineered vampires solve problems intractable to baseline humans and soldiers come with zombie switches that shut off self-awareness during combat. And it’s all under surveillance by an alien presence that refuses to show itself.
  >
  > Daniel Bruks is a living fossil: a field biologist in a world where biology has turned computational, a cat's-paw used by terrorists to kill thousands. Taking refuge in the Oregon desert, he’s turned his back on a humanity that shatters into strange new subspecies with every heartbeat. But he awakens one night to find himself at the center of a storm that will turn all of history inside-out.
  >
  > Now he’s trapped on a ship bound for the center of the solar system. To his left is a grief-stricken soldier, obsessed by whispered messages from a dead son. To his right is a pilot who hasn’t yet found the man she's sworn to kill on sight. A vampire and its entourage of zombie bodyguards lurk in the shadows behind. And dead ahead, a handful of rapture-stricken monks takes them all to a meeting with something they will only call “The Angels of the Asteroids.”
  >
  > Their pilgrimage brings Dan Bruks, the fossil man, face-to-face with the biggest evolutionary breakpoint since the origin of thought itself.
</details>

#### [Manifold series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49783-manifold) (1999-2003) _by [Stephen Baxter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baxter_(author)>)_ [3.8 avg]

Stephen Baxter explores the Fermi Paradox in different ways over the course of three books (and a collection of novellas), in a gloriously hard scifi style. It is very thought provoking, and also utterly brutal and bleak. Space and time is cold and uncaring. - [@nahkampf](https://github.com/nahkampf)

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > Each one of the main novels deals with a possible resolution to the Fermi paradox. The first, Time, is set in a universe that is completely devoid of intelligent life beyond that of mankind and its creations (i.e. A.I. and uplifted animals).
  >
  > The second in the series, Space, proposes the opposite: that life is endemic to the universe, and there is intelligence in nearly all possible places of the cosmos. The solution to the Fermi Paradox in this novel is that intelligent life is continually wiped out by cosmic disasters before it has time to spread too far.
  >
  > The third novel, Origin, is set in a multiverse that is a compromise between the ideals in the first two novels: that life is only on Earth, but at the same time is everywhere. This novel solves the Fermi Paradox by suggesting that intelligent life is segregated into separate parallel universes.
</details>

#### [Nexus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24968342-nexus) (2012) _by [Ramez Naam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramez_Naam)_ [4.1]

Near-future hard Sci-Fi at its best. Lots of awards and endorsements, even a [thumbs up](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/494337667035697152) from John Carmack. Can't go wrong. - [@christianboyle](https://github.com/christianboyle)

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > In the near future, the experimental nano-drug Nexus can link humans together, mind to mind. There are some who want to improve it. There are some who want to eradicate it. And there are others who just want to exploit it.
  >
  > When a young scientist is caught improving Nexus, he’s thrust over his head into a world of danger and international espionage—for there is far more at stake than anyone realizes.
  >
  > From the halls of academe to the halls of power; from the headquarters of an elite agency in Washington, D.C. to a secret lab beneath Shanghai; from the underground parties of San Francisco to the illegal biotech markets of Bangkok; from an international neuroscience conference to a remote monastery in the mountains of Thailand—Nexus is a thrill ride through a future on the brink of explosion.
</details>

#### [Permutation City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156784.Permutation_City) (1994) _by [Greg Egan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Egan)_ [4.1]

With all the ideas contained in Permutation City, a typical Sci-Fi author would have written at least 5 separate books. - [@uraimo](https://github.com/uraimo)

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > In the not-too-distant future, technology has given birth to a form of immortality. The human mind can be scanned and uploaded into a virtual reality program to become a perfect electronic “Copy,” aware of itself. A new Copy finds himself forced to cooperate in scientific experiments with the flesh-and-blood man he was copied from.
</details>

#### [Red Mars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77507.Red_Mars) (1993) _by [Kim Stanley Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson)_ [3.8]

An interesting take on the near-future colonization of Mars by one hundred of the world's greatest scientists, filled with political intrigue and "hard science" alike. Admittedly some parts can be a slog, think A Song of Ice and Fire: awesome narrative in the grand scheme, with perhaps a bit too much description of Martian landscape/house sigils. - [@rubzo](https://github.com/rubzo)

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > For eons, sandstorms have swept the barren desolate landscape of the red planet. For centuries, Mars has beckoned to mankind to come and conquer its hostile climate. Now, in the year 2026, a group of one hundred colonists is about to fulfill that destiny. John Boone, Maya Toitavna, Frank Chalmers, and Arkady Bogdanov lead a mission whose ultimate goal is the terraforming of Mars. For some, Mars will become a passion driving them to daring acts of courage and madness; for others it offers and opportunity to strip the planet of its riches. And for the genetic “alchemists,” Mars presents a chance to create a biomedical miracle, a breakthrough that could change all we know about life… and death.

#### [Schild’s Ladder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156780.Schild_s_Ladder) (2002) _by [Greg Egan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Egan)_ [3.9]

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > Twenty thousand years into the future, an experiment in quantum physics has had a catastrophic result, creating an enormous, rapidly expanding vacuum that devours everything it comes in contact with. Now humans must confront this deadly expansion. Tchicaya, aboard a starship trawling the border of the vacuum, has allied himself with the Yielders—those determined to study the vacuum while allowing it to grow unchecked. But when his fiery first love, Mariama, reenters his life on the side of the Preservationists—those working to halt and destroy the vacuum—Tchicaya finds himself struggling with an inner turmoil he has known since childhood.
  >
  > However, in the center of the vacuum, something is developing that neither Tchicaya and the Yielders nor Mariama and the Preservationists could ever have imagined possible: life.
</details>

#### [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian) (2012) _by [Andy Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Weir_%28writer%29)_ [4.4]

This is a fun read; Weir manages to write an evocative techno-thriller without having his characters stoop to constant navel gazing and lonesome pining. This could be described as Robinson Crusoe - in Space. The characters on the earth side aren't the greatest, but the humor throughout the book really pulls it together, and watching a master at work as far as mechanical engineering goes was fascinating. Loved it. - [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  > _Apollo 13_ meets _Cast Away_ in this grippingly detailed, brilliantly ingenious man-vs-nature survival thriller, set on the surface of Mars. Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first men to walk on the surface of Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first man to die there.
  >
  > It started with the dust storm that holed his suit and nearly killed him, and that forced his crew to leave him behind, sure he was already dead. Now he’s stranded millions of miles from the nearest human being, with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his food would be gone years before a rescue mission could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to get him first.
  
  > But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. But will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?
</details>

#### [The Sands of Mars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149063.The_Sands_of_Mars) (1951) _by [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke)_ [3.7]

This book is most interesting for its pretty cool take on terraforming a planet, and how that goes both for the inhabitants and what it means for nationalism (or planetism, as it were). - [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)

  <summary>Description</summary>

  > Space writers holiday. When a celebrated science fiction writer takes to space on his first trip to Mars, he’s sure to be in for some heckling from the spaceship crew. But Martin Gibson, man about space, takes it all in his stride. That is, until he lands on the red planet. Once there the intrepid author causes one problem after another as he stumbles upon Mars’ most carefully hidden secrets and threatens the future of an entire planet.
