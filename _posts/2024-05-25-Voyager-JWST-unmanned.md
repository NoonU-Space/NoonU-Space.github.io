The remaining 100 modules would dive deeper into specific sub-systems, case studies analyzing lessons learned from past missions, hands-on projects to design and prototype key technologies, systems integration exercises to bring everything together, reliability engineering, extensive testing and qualification, and finally culminating in the detailed design and development planning for the full-scale Dyson Sphere system. Testing and analysis of critical subsystems using the environments and facilities discussed earlier would also be a key focus.

The program would require extensive lab and testing facilities to support the development of technologies and techniques for this ambitious project. Access to data and knowledge gained from past unmanned probe missions would also be essential.

Key areas of technological innovation required would be in the realms of energy harvesting and transmission, autonomous swarm operations, advanced materials and structures, precision navigation and control, and integration of large-scale space systems. A focus on reliability, fault tolerance and self-repair will also be critical for a project of this scale and complexity intended to operate for very long durations.

Hopefully this gives a high-level overview of what a program of this scope might entail, but let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions! It's certainly an exciting and ambitious undertaking.
