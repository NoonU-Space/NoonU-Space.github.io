It's probably necessary to START with a debate about the Constitution of the Dyson Sphere, even though completion of the Dyson Sphere might be 250 to 1,000 years in the future. The scale of the project transcends human-scale thinking in every dimension, ESPECIALLY Time ... at MINIMUM, it will almost certainly take ten 25-year generations to build. The project will NEED to be primarily self-funding; the project will involve the develop of scientific knowledge especially in the realm of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) and the growth and regeneration processes of *living* things *like* [mycorrhizal networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network) or [biological neurol networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(biology)) that we do not yet fully understand in order to enable the architectural design and knowledge to do the large scale engineering and development of ***truly*** autonomous [ie unsupervised for centuries] robotic drones. *Whatever we imagine Dyson Spheres might look like today, the actual realized implementation will be VERY DIFFERENT ... but we we must start with the knowledge that we have now*.

We do need to think about enabling institutions such as FOSS licenses that underpin the technological projects that will develop into the Constitution of the Dyson Sphere.  It's important to understand how important this will be. The mega structure will ultimately need to occupy at least 10,000X the energy generation/use, productivity in terms of human-necessary services, knowledgebase and computational power ... the surface area of Earth will be for Earth-based life ... and a significant portion of the energy harvested from the Dyson Sphere might be devoted to terraforming other exoplanets, but the overwhelmingly large proportion of the value produced in this solar system will come from this Sun, harvested and redirected by the Dyson Sphere.

## Governance, Ownership and Compensation

Georgism, also called in modern times Geoism, and known historically as the single tax movement, is an economic ideology holding that **humans should own the value that they produce themselves**, while the economic rent derived from *land*—including from all natural resources, the commons, ideas/intellectual property and urban locations—should belong equally to all members of society. Developed from the writings of American economist and social reformer [Henry George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George), the Georgist paradigm seeks solutions to social and ecological problems, based on principles of land/property rights and public finance that attempt to integrate economic efficiency with social justice.

Some might not immediately make the connection betweeen Geoism and intellectual property and FREE open source licenses. The idea of Georgism is that the value of land is created by the community, and therefore the community should benefit from that value. This is similar to the idea of FOSS licenses, where the value of the software is created by the community, and therefore the community should benefit from that value. In other words, the value of the software is not created by the individual developer, but by the community as a whole. Therefore, the community should have the right to use, modify, and distribute the software as they see fit.

Georgism is concerned with the distribution of economic rent caused by land ownership, natural monopolies, pollution rights, and control of the commons, including title of ownership for natural resources and other contrived privileges such as intellectual property. 

Any natural resource which is inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical and most significant example of land monopoly involves the extraction of common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that taxing economic rent is efficient, fair, and equitable. The main Georgist policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value, arguing that revenues from a land value tax (LVT) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing taxes (such as on income, trade, or purchases) that are unfair and inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue to the people by means of a basic income or citizen's dividend.

## Weighted Commitgraph Compensation 

Not all commits are equal. Some commits are more valuable than others. For example, a commit that fixes a critical bug is more valuable than a commit that fixes a typo in the documentation. Therefore, it makes sense to compensate developers based on the value of their commits. This is similar to the idea of a land value tax, where the value of the land is assessed based on its productive capacity. In the same way, the value of a commit can be assessed based on its impact on the project. One way to implement this is through a weighted commitgraph, where each commit is assigned a weight based on its value. The weight of a commit can be determined by various factors, such as the number of lines of code changed, the number of bugs fixed, the number of tests added, and so on. Developers can then be compensated primarily based on the total weight of their commits ... developers, let's say *emeritus* committers who have contributed heavily to a product, might be tenured staff members could recieve a minimal monthly base stipend for reviewing commits.
