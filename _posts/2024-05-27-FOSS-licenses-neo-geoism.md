Georgism, also called in modern times Geoism, and known historically as the single tax movement, is an economic ideology holding that people should own the value that they produce themselves, while the economic rent derived from land—including from all natural resources, the commons, and urban locations—should belong equally to all members of society. Developed from the writings of American economist and social reformer Henry George, the Georgist paradigm seeks solutions to social and ecological problems, based on principles of land rights and public finance that attempt to integrate economic efficiency with social justice.

What might this have to do with intellectual property and FREE open source licenses? Well, the idea of Georgism is that the value of land is created by the community, and therefore the community should benefit from that value. This is similar to the idea of FOSS licenses, where the value of the software is created by the community, and therefore the community should benefit from that value. In other words, the value of the software is not created by the individual developer, but by the community as a whole. Therefore, the community should have the right to use, modify, and distribute the software as they see fit.

Georgism is concerned with the distribution of economic rent caused by land ownership, natural monopolies, pollution rights, and control of the commons, including title of ownership for natural resources and other contrived privileges such as intellectual property. 

Any natural resource which is inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical and most significant example of land monopoly involves the extraction of common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that taxing economic rent is efficient, fair, and equitable. The main Georgist policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value, arguing that revenues from a land value tax (LVT) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing taxes (such as on income, trade, or purchases) that are unfair and inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue to the people by means of a basic income or citizen's dividend.

## Weighted Commitgraph Compensation 

Not all commits are equal. Some commits are more valuable than others. For example, a commit that fixes a critical bug is more valuable than a commit that fixes a typo in the documentation. Therefore, it makes sense to compensate developers based on the value of their commits. This is similar to the idea of a land value tax, where the value of the land is assessed based on its productive capacity. In the same way, the value of a commit can be assessed based on its impact on the project. One way to implement this is through a weighted commitgraph, where each commit is assigned a weight based on its value. The weight of a commit can be determined by various factors, such as the number of lines of code changed, the number of bugs fixed, the number of tests added, and so on. Developers can then be compensated primarily based on the total weight of their commits ... developers, let's say *emeritus* committers who have contributed heavily to a product, might be tenured staff members could recieve a minimal monthly base stipend for reviewing commits.
