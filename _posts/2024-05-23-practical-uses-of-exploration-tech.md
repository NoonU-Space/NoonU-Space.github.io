## What IS Exploration Technology?

**Exploration technology is about the JOY of discovery of things that are practically useful** 

Exploration is about the thrill of the *Aha!* moment, that moment of child-like euphoric exuberance when we figure out how the toy works on the basic level so that we can *play with* our knowledge and then figure out how the toy works on the next level.

Exploration is the *purest* form of PLAY that human mind is capable of.

It's about the excitement of the new. It's about the creativity of the human imagination.

Exploration technology is a term that we use to refers to the tools, techniques, and methods used to explore and study the Physical nature of the Universe. This can include everything from telescopes and microscopes and instruments and automation and satellites and swarms of drones to mathematics and neurology and ecosystems and living organisms. The goal of exploration technology is to help us better LIVE in the universe beyond.

We start be exploring what we know ... and then by taking that empirical knowledge gained from efficient and rigorous systems of experiments and observations to begin to make inductive inferences and intuitive hypotheses about what we don't know. Our fractal-like body of knowledge extends in the fashion of [mycorrhizal networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network) or [biological neurol networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(biology)) as we BEGIN to understand the parts of the Universe that humans can understand ... but we must always remember that the spectacular beauty of Universe and all of the physical laws governing how things work in that Universe is always going to be much larger than we can ever know.

This means that exploration is a spectacular never-ending process of the discovery of the Creation of the Origins of our Universe ... it's NEVER over ... there will NEVER be a point where we know all that we can know ... we are INCAPABLE of reaching that moment. We can NEVER be equivalent to the Creator of those Origins; we must never claim to even be able to know the Mind of the Creator and we should avoid anthropomorphizing the Creator, thinking that we put ourselves in the place of the Creator or that we can speak for the Creator.
