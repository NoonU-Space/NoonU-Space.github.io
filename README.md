[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DAJYuBTKBl2gDairss4cjWB8qdKK09CNzbRJdNZ2eC4/edit?usp=sharing) outlines a 250-point strategic roadmap for the collaborative development of a solar-orbiting Dyson swarm megastructure over the next 500-1000 years. The roadmap emphasizes open source principles, hard science fiction constraints, and the gradual accumulation of necessary technologies and expertise. This living document will be revised ANNUALLY through constitutional conventions of this hard science fiction knowledge development community while maintaining its core mission of benefiting all of humanity.

It should be stressed that the objective is energy harvesting from atomic mass; the starting foundation for developing resources for sufficient energy necessary for experimental investigations into the fundamental nature of atomic mass is thought to be likely derived from energy released by stars like our sun. In other words, a large energy harvesting megastructure is necessary for the very, very, very large-scale, i.e. interplanetary or larger, particle accelerators and space exploration technologies necessary in order to do experimental physics at galactic scale. The Dyson swarm approach is not the only approach to liberate and then harvest and channel energy; this approach is only a starting point for the discussion.

In the process of developing the hard science fiction conceptual theory for implementing this megastructure, the project will also produce positive knowledge externalities and spin-off technologies, ie initial generation of hard science fiction theory will enable future generations of even more imaginative, yet Realistic hard science fiction and applied mathematics while also providing practical, testable hypotheses which will lead to genuine NON-FICTION scientific discovery and applied or practical proof of hard science fictions concepts and ideas.
