# Gathering Intelligence

This is about the tools that we use to collect knowledge and gather intelligence related to every topic that might impact this project. In essence, gathering intelligence is really about SLOWING DOWN and going back to the most fundmental nature of the most fundmental things that we simply take for granted.

Before we start gathering intelligence, we need to know what we are gathering, what kinds of things we looking for, where to look ... and the vocabulary and general familiarity with topics in order to ask a decent question and follow-up questions. 

It is the requirement of having a sufficient vocabulary to carry on a decent conversation that is where the prerequisite knowledge comes in.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

In order to develop the necessary prerequisite knowledge for structuring the architecture of our intelligence gatherinn process we need to think about things like understanding the precursor ideas necessary to understand how and why topological quantum field theories go beyond usual notions of locality in space-time.

As an example, the following syllabus listed below covers a vast range of topics in mathematics, physics, and their interdisciplinary intersection. It starts with foundational material in pure mathematics [which, nowadays, might involve into something like becoming proficient with the use of Mathematica and Wolfram language, rather than doing math on a chalkboard in front of a class of graduate-level Math students], classical physics, quantum mechanics, and quantum field theory. It then delves into the rich interplay between topology, geometry, and physics, with a focus on gauge theories, quantum gravity, and string theory.

The core section on topological quantum field theories builds up from the axiomatic foundations to the deep connections with conformal field theory, representation theory, and category theory. It explores the many facets and applications of TQFTs, from invariants of knots and manifolds to quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

The final section ventures into advanced and specialized topics at the cutting edge of current research, showcasing the stunning breadth and depth of the field. From enumerative geometry and mirror symmetry to noncommutative geometry and quantum topology, these modules offer a glimpse into the frontiers of mathematical physics.

Throughout the syllabus, the emphasis is on cultivating a conceptual understanding of the key ideas and techniques, while also developing the necessary mathematical sophistication to follow the contemporary literature. The non-local aspects of TQFTs, such as the independence of the spacetime metric and the sensitivity to global topology, are recurring themes that are gradually elaborated and refined.

Completing this syllabus would provide a solid foundation for research in topological quantum field theory and related areas of mathematical physics. It would also equip the student with a versatile toolbox and a broad perspective for tackling interdisciplinary problems across the physical sciences.
